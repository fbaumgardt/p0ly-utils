"""Raw EEG ingestion dispatcher.

Single entry point :func:`load_raw` selects a per-format reader by dispatching
on the **type** of ``source``:

* ``str | Path | os.PathLike`` → BrainVision reader (a concrete ``.vhdr`` path).
* :class:`mne_bids.BIDSPath`   → mne-bids reader (``read_raw_bids``).

The library is **path- and layout-agnostic** (ADR-005): it composes no
filesystem paths and builds no :class:`BIDSPath`. The pipeline owns all layout
(``sub-{subject}_task-{task}.vhdr`` naming, BIDS entity construction) and
hands the library a fully resolved ``source``.

This module is stateless and decoupled from Snakemake: it reads from the
filesystem and returns an :class:`mne.io.BaseRaw` but never writes derivative
files. Pipeline scripts are responsible for saving.

Forward compatibility (US-009): the ``str | Path`` branch will widen to also
accept ``list[str | Path]`` for multi-segment recording merge, with no
dispatcher rewrite.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vhdr
        Concrete path to the BrainVision ``.vhdr`` header file (any path-like
        object). Pipeline-owned; the library composes no paths.
