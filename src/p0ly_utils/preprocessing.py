    Peak-to-peak amplitude is computed per channel (axis='channels') or per

    iteratively. At each step the mean and std are re-estimated on the unmasked
    subset, so earlier outliers don't inflate the baseline.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inst
        MNE object to score. When ``axis='channels'``, ``inst.get_data()``
        has shape ``(n_channels, n_times)`` (a ``Raw``). When ``axis='time'``,

        (an ``Epochs`` object) — the data is averaged over channels first so
        that the score reflects per-epoch amplitude.
    axis
        ``'channels'`` to flag outlier channels (per-channel peak-to-peak),
        ``'time'`` to flag outlier epochs (per-epoch peak-to-peak).
    threshold
        Z-score cutoff; samples with ``|z| >= threshold`` are flagged.
    max_iter
        Number of iterative refinement passes (re-estimate mean/std on the
        unmasked subset each pass).
    mask
        Optional pre-existing boolean mask of shape ``(n_channels,)`` or
        ``(n_epochs,)``; masked entries are excluded from the baseline.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Boolean mask of shape ``(n_channels,)`` when ``axis='channels'`` or
        ``(n_epochs,)`` when ``axis='time'``. ``True`` marks an outlier.

    icalabel_threshold
        ICLabel predicted-class probability cutoff; ignored unless

    interval_window_ms
        Sliding-window length in milliseconds (converted to seconds). The
